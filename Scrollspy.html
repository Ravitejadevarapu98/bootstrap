		<ol>
		<li>crollspy toggles the .active class on anchor (<a>) elements when the element with the id referenced by the anchor’s href is scrolled into view. Scrollspy is best used in conjunction with a Bootstrap nav component or list group, but it will also work with any anchor elements in the current page. Here’s how it works.
On the scrollable container, add data-bs-spy="scroll" and data-bs-target="#navId" where navId is the unique id of the associated navigation. If there is no focusable element inside the element, be sure to also include a tabindex="0" to ensure keyboard access.
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<li>2 To start, scrollspy requires two things: a navigation, list group, or a simple set of links, plus a scrollable container. The scrollable container can be the  or a custom element with a set height and overflow-y: scroll.
</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<li>3 As you scroll the “spied” container, an .active class is added and removed from anchor links within the associated navigation. Links must have resolvable id targets, otherwise they’re ignored. For example, a <a href="#home">home</a> must correspond to something in the DOM like <div id="home"></div>
</li></li>
	</ol>
	</div>
